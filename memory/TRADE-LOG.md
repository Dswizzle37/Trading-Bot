## 2026-08-17 — BUY NVDA
- **Ticker:** NVDA | **Side:** buy | **Shares:** 66 | **Entry:** $225.88 avg
- **Cost:** $14,907.93 (14.9% of equity)
- **Stop:** 10% trailing GTC, accepted (trailed to $205.13 by close)
- **Thesis:** Tech is the clear S&P sector-momentum leader (XLK +4.2% on the week). NVDA is the liquid large-cap AI-infra proxy on Blackwell demand + hyperscaler capex, positioned ahead of Aug 26 earnings.
- **Target:** ~$258 | **R:R:** 2:1+
- Gate checks passed: position count, 20% size cap, catalyst documented, PDT room. Trade 1/3 for the week.

### Aug 17 — EOD Snapshot (Day 1, Monday)
**Portfolio:** $100,112.36 | **Cash:** $85,092.07 (85%) | **Day P&L:** +$112.36 (+0.11%) | **Phase P&L:** +$112.36 (+0.11%)

| Ticker | Shares | Entry | Close | Day Chg | Unrealized P&L | Stop |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| NVDA | 66 | $225.88 | $227.62 | +0.77% | +$114.99 | $205.13 (10% trail) |

**Notes:** First trade of the account. Only 15% of capital deployed vs. the 75-85% strategy target — notably under-invested, expect to add positions as further catalysts qualify. Trades this week: 1/3.

> **Reconstructed entry.** Day 1's routines executed correctly against Alpaca, but their commits could not be pushed (GitHub App integration returned 403 on all writes) and the containers recycled before the fix landed. These two sections were re-entered by hand on 2026-08-17 from the routines' notification output so the log stays continuous — the underlying Alpaca trade and position are real and unaffected. Push now goes through `scripts/gitpush.sh` with a PAT instead.

## 2026-08-18 — BUY XLE
- **Ticker:** XLE | **Side:** buy | **Shares:** 300 | **Entry:** $63.5553 avg
- **Cost:** $19,066.60 (19.1% of equity)
- **Stop:** 10% trailing GTC, accepted — $57.20 (hwm $63.555)
- **Thesis:** Energy is the S&P month-to-date sector-momentum leader (+9.34%). US-Iran ceasefire talks collapsed overnight and Iran shifted to an offensive posture, driving crude to multi-week highs (WTI $82→$85, Brent $88→$91). XLE broke to a 52-week high on the move. This executed idea #1 from the 8/17 research log, whose trigger — clean price read at the open plus a specific catalyst — fired on both conditions.
- **Target:** ~$76.27 | **R:R:** 2:1 (tail-dependent — see risk note)
- Gate checks passed: 2 positions ≤ 6, 19.1% ≤ 20% size cap, catalyst documented in today's RESEARCH-LOG, daytrade count 0 (PDT room clear). Trade 2/3 for the week.
- **Risk note:** entry is at the top of the 52-week range ($42.28-$63.46) after ~+40% YTD, and the driver is a geopolitical risk premium that can mean-revert violently on a de-escalation headline. The 10% trail, not the $76 target, is what caps the downside. Chose XLE over CVX/XOM (both quoting ~$14 spreads, untradeable) and over COP (clean quote but no company-specific catalyst to justify single-name risk at this size).

### Aug 19 — EOD Snapshot (Day 3, Wednesday)
**Portfolio:** $99,444.01 | **Cash:** $66,025.45 (66%) | **Day P&L:** -$188.28 (-0.19%) | **Phase P&L:** -$555.99 (-0.56%)

| Ticker | Shares | Entry | Close | Day Chg | Unrealized P&L | Stop |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| NVDA | 66 | $225.88 | $217.66 | -0.95% | -$542.37 (-3.64%) | $205.13 (10% trail, hwm $227.92) |
| XLE | 300 | $63.5553 | $63.51 | -0.27% | -$13.60 (-0.07%) | $57.83 (10% trail, hwm $64.25) |

**Notes:** No trades today — third weekly slot (2/3 used) held per the market-open research call: XLV's momentum thesis disconfirmed, XOP/OIH rejected on energy concentration, ADI thesis strong but spread untradeable post-earnings. Both positions inside the -7% cut line, both stops >3% from price, no stop moved. Deployment 33.8%, still below the 75-85% target — third session running. Day P&L uses Alpaca's `last_equity` ($99,632.29) since no 8/18 EOD snapshot was logged that day; underlying trades and positions are unaffected.

### Aug 20 — EOD Snapshot (Day 4, Thursday)
**Portfolio:** $99,469.15 | **Cash:** $66,025.45 (66%) | **Day P&L:** +$10.74 (+0.01%) | **Phase P&L:** -$530.85 (-0.53%)

| Ticker | Shares | Entry | Close | Day Chg | Unrealized P&L | Stop |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| NVDA | 66 | $225.88 | $216.95 | -0.28% | -$589.23 (-3.95%) | $205.13 (10% trail, hwm $227.92) |
| XLE | 300 | $63.5553 | $63.75 | +0.27% | +$58.40 (+0.31%) | $58.23 (10% trail, hwm $64.70) |

**Notes:** Flat day — no trades, no fills, no position changes. NVDA gave back a little (-0.28%) and XLE ticked up (+0.27%), netting +$10.74 on the day. Both trailing stops are live GTC and untouched by the bot; XLE's trailed itself up to $58.23 on a $64.70 high-water mark, NVDA's still sits at $205.13. Both positions are inside the -7% manual-cut line (NVDA -3.95% is the one to watch, with earnings Aug 26) and both stops are more than 3% below price. Deployment 33.6% — fourth straight session well under the 75-85% target, which remains the standing gap in this book. Third weekly trade slot still open (2/3 used). Day P&L is measured against Alpaca's official prior close of $99,458.41; the logged 8/19 snapshot of $99,444.01 was captured before the settle, so log-to-log reads +$25.14.
